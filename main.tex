\begin{abstract}
Since the beginning of team sports, people have been living with a fantasy of a "dream team". More specifically, a team composing of players who can maximize the team's performance/win-rate would naturally gain an advantage against other teams. However, we have also witnessed teams with multiple superstars fail miserably. In this paper, I would try to identify what makes a winning team in soccer, and what makes a good player, using data analytic  tools. I would also try to  build my own "dream team" based on the results I find.

\section*{Introduction}

T
\section*{Methods and Materials}

Guidelines can be included for standard research article sections, such as this one.

\section*{Some \LaTeX{} Examples}
\label{sec:examples}

Use section and subsection commands to organize your document. \LaTeX{} handles all the formatting and numbering automatically. Use ref and label commands for cross-references.

\subsection*{Figures and Tables}

Use the table and tabular commands for basic tables --- see Table~\ref{tab:widgets}, for example. You can upload a figure (JPEG, PNG or PDF) using the project menu. To include it in your document, use the includegraphics command as in the code for Figure~\ref{fig:view} below.

\begin{figure}[ht]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{frog}
\caption{An example image of a frog.}
\label{fig:view}
\end{figure}

\begin{table}[ht]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{l|r}
Item & Quantity \\\hline
Candles & 4 \\
Fork handles & ?  
\end{tabular}
\caption{\label{tab:widgets}An example table.}
\end{table}

\subsection*{Citations}

LaTeX formats citations and references automatically using the bibliography records in your .bib file, which you can edit via the project menu. Use the cite command for an inline citation, like \cite{lees2010theoretical}, and the citep command for a citation in parentheses \citep{lees2010theoretical}.

\subsection*{Mathematics}

\LaTeX{} is great at typesetting mathematics. Let $X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_n$ be a sequence of independent and identically distributed random variables with $\text{E}[X_i] = \mu$ and $\text{Var}[X_i] = \sigma^2 < \infty$, and let
$$S_n = \frac{X_1 + X_2 + \cdots + X_n}{n}
      = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i}^{n} X_i$$
denote their mean. Then as $n$ approaches infinity, the random variables $\sqrt{n}(S_n - \mu)$ converge in distribution to a normal $\mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2)$.

\subsection*{Lists}

You can make lists with automatic numbering \dots

\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep] 
\item Like this,
\item and like this.
\end{enumerate}
\dots or bullet points \dots
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep] 
\item Like this,
\item and like this.
\end{itemize}
\dots or with words and descriptions \dots
\begin{description}
\item[Word] Definition
\item[Concept] Explanation
\item[Idea] Text
\end{description}
